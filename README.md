## 📝 FAQ

#### 🤔 What is an Emote Sound?

Emote sounds are triggered when a user types a certain phrase into Twitch chat, playing a sound effect. For example, if there is a sound for the word `hiii` and the user types `hiii hello streamer`, it will trigger the sound set for `hiii`.

#### ❔ Why do that?

It is a fun way for chatters to directly interact with the stream. The emotes/phrases are typically associated with an emotion or response. For example, `no` or `yes` sounds, or `xdx` being a trolling/gremlin response.

#### 💅 Customizing

The app allows you to upload as many sounds to a single phrase as you want. You can set the volume for each phrase, but not for specific sounds. There is an option to change the play rate; say you want to only have a 20% chance for a sound to trigger because you have a very active chat, this will allow you to throttle it. You can also have multiple sounds in that trigger with different chances. Think sub alerts: you may want a special unique sound that has a 1% chance.

A feature not prominently shown is that you can split the name of the trigger with a comma for multiple valid phrases. For example, name:`hi,hii,hiii` would be a valid phrase for each of those words.
